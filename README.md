# RL OS
RL OS is a project to create an x86-64 Operating system from the ground up, using my own bootloader and kernel.
The goal is to understand the inner workings of operating systems.
RL OS will support features such as multitasking, memory paging, a user-friendly interface, and an established file system.

## Goals
- Multitasking
- Memory Paging
- User-Friendly Interface
- File system

## Currently working on:
- Memory Management
