### ** This Project is NOT COMPLETE; it was used to learn about Operating Systems and their development **

# RL OS
RL OS is a project to create an x86-64 Operating system from the ground up, using my own bootloader and kernel.

The goal is to understand the inner workings of operating systems.

RL OS loads the C++ kernel in x86-64 long mode, has basic interrupt handling, allows keyboard input, and displays text.

## What I Learned
- Memory Management
- Memory Paging
- Interrupt Handling
- File Systems
